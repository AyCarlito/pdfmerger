# PDF Merger

A python implementation using pypdf2 to create combined pdfs for lectures. The script scans each directory, finds all pdfs in a single directory and creates a combined pdf from it.

The program can be run by executing the shell script

```
merge.sh
```

This will install the required python modules and run the program.
